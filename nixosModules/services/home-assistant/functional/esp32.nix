  Simple esphome service config. Service authentication is to be done through
  an SSH tunnel.

  Some notes:

  - When just deployed â€“ all installs were failing because `g++` binary
    downloaded by esphome was not executable. I fixed it by `chown` everything
    in `/var/lib/private/esphome` to `esphome:esphome`
